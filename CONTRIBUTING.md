# Contributions and feedback

Contributions are welcome via GitHub issues. Before opening an issue, please check whether [a ticket already exists](../../issues) that describes your intention. Our [status board](https://github.com/orgs/swiyu-admin-ch/projects/2)Â provides you with an overview of the status of your enquiry.

Since we only publish snapshots of the code until further notice, we cannot process pull requests.

The development of Public Beta is taking place within a tight timeframe. We do our best to respond to your feedback as quickly as possible.

Thank you for your contribution
